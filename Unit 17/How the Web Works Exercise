# Part One: Solidify Terminology
 - What is HTTP?
     - HTTP/Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the protocol used for communication between browsers and servers.

 - What is a URL?
     - A URL is like a home address for websites. They make it possible for browsers to locate and open the specific webpages.

 - What is DNS?
     - DNS/Domain Name Service is responsible for transforming a URL's hostname into an IP address.

 - What is a query string?
     - A query string is part of a URL that is responsible for storing extra bits of data, such as search terms.

 - What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
     - GET: A request made to the server that does not change any data. 
     - POST: A request made to the server which will also change its data.

 - What is an HTTP request?
     - Once a user enters a URL, the browser sends a GET request to the server where that URL is located.

 - What is an HTTP response?
     - The server checks the other database servers and returns the exact HTML text for that page.

 - What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
     - Headers provide additional information about the request or the response.

 - What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
     - Turns the hostname into an IP address, and connects to it.
     - On Port 80 (The default one), the browser makes a request to the IP (It also passes along the query string just in case there's any other info).
     - The servers then returns a response if successful, to which the Browser makes a DOM from the code gathered.
     - The browser will also make separate HTTP requests for each resource the webpage

# Part Two: Practice Tools
 - Using curl, make a GET request to the icanhazdadjoke.com API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”
     - $ curl https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search\?term\=pirate

 - Use dig to find what the IP address is for icanhazdadjoke.com
     - dig /icanhazdadjoke.com

 - Make a simple web page and serve it using python3 -m http.server. Visit the page in a browser.
     - mkdir simpleWebPage/
     - cd simpleWebPage/
     - touch simpleWebPage
     - python3 -m http.server
     - Type in the local host url and visit in the webpage.
